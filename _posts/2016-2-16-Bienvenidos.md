*Bienvenidos means 'Welcome' in Spanish*

As this is my first post in my blog, I just want to say, to whoever is reading this, welcome and thank you!

I'm not completely sure on what I will talk about here day in and day out: I guess sometimes you know where you start, and have some idea on what you want to do, to deliver, but then things change on the way. I'm not even certain that I am clear on the latter, but for now what I'll do is to try to work on a little project for a few days/weeks and then post about it, even if it's short, or an incomplete or partial analysis. My motivation as an aspiring Data Scientist is to learn as much as possible! and maybe you, my dear reader might use my posts as a starting point for your own work, or, better yet, have suggestions and feedback! 

I will also try to put in between technical posts some thoughts about talks I've attended, books I've read, or other ramblings.

Enjoy!
