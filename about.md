I am a cosmologist and aspiring data scientist. My journey started studying astronomy at Universidad de Chile, in Santiago. In 2010 I finished my PhD in Astronomy at The University of Chicago, and then I came to Australia to work as a Postdoctoral Researcher at Swinburne University in Melbourne. My main interests focused on Observational Cosmology; in particular, I used statistics of the spatial distibution of galaxies to understand the origin and evolution of the Universe. 

Last year I decided to make the jump outside academia and I am looking for opportunities to work in Data Science and Business Analytics. I believe my background and skills transfer to this area and I am particularly interested in problems where data analysis can bring insights to solve problems affecting lots of people. 

I'm a proud father of a 5-year old boy and a baby girl, and in my free time I enjoy running, listening to all kinds of music, salsa dancing, playing guitar, a good novel, or just enjoying a good TV show.

##About this site

Here I will be writing (briefly I hope!) some thoughts on data science problems, cosmology and career. Thoughts and comments are welcome!
